- Check out the [YouTube Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9eMGE7QtTk&t=535s) I followed to build this app.

## 🚀 Getting Started

In the project directory, you can run a few commands to get up and running:

### `npm start`

Fires up the app in development mode.\
Head over to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see it in action.\
The page will reload if you make edits. Neat, right?

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.\
For more details, check out [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).

### `npm run build`

Bundles the app for production in the `build` folder.\
It optimizes the build for the best performance. Your app is ready to go live!

### `npm run eject`

**Warning: Once you eject, you can't go back!**\
This command will copy all the configuration files and dependencies right into your project, giving you full control. Use it only if you need to customize the build tool and configuration.
